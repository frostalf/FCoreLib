FCoreLib is a simple and personal library used on most of my plugins, it is not meant for public use but if you wanna give it a try, it does include a very simple (and poorly written) documentation in code. I was getting sick of having to update the same piece of code on almost 70 plugins, so was born FCoreLib.
